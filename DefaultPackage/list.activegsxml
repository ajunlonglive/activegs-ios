		This was the first major development of the team on the Apple II : the game included 100 levels, 
		a level-editor (hence its tagline the "buildable break-out"!), 
		and a end-game animation that no-one has ever seen!<br />
		
		The game was fully programmed by entering each byte code directly onto the sectors using a disk editor (Moby Disk II):
		years after, it is hard to imagine that it could even run but, at that time, we didn't know what an assembler was
		(nor the difference between object and source code).<br />
		
		Under the Second Sight Software Label, the was presented at the French Apple Expo in 1987, 
		and sent to major US publishing companies in the USA (Epyx, DataSoft, Electronics Art, ...). 
		It received very good feedback from those professionals, which impressed the teenagers we were.<br />

		Unfortunately, the Apple II was fading away and publishing new titles did not make much sense
		while the IIGS was just being launched : eventually, the game finished its life as a freeware for the pleasure of players all around the world!

    With friends from Savoie, Pierre and Dany developed this state-of-the art 3D real time game (released, under the Sergent Claude label).
    This game was highly appreciated by the Second Sight Software members, and it was then decided to create a new team that 
    would be composed of naturally complementary members in design, art, music, metal- and math- powered development: FTA was born.

		<p><b>The demo that has made FTA the famous beyond their Dijon &amp; Aix-Les-Bains hideouts !</b></p>
    <p>
		It has evolved from a simple parametric-based animation (thanks to Arkanoid for the sprites!) to a full 3D-powered demo with modern graphics and fancy musics.
		Even though there was a bug in the 3D calculation (the shapes should never have collapsed onto themselves), people loved the demo.
		</p>
    <p>
    In less than 2 weeks, the first version spread quickly from Dijon to <a target="_blank" href="http://groups.google.fr/group/comp.sys.apple/browse_thread/thread/79404fd00b1c66c2/33488ef31805980e?hl=fr&lnk=gst&q=nucleus++#33488ef31805980e">Cupertino</a>, 
		where the Green Software Engineering team reviewed it. Unfortunately, due to a glitch in a low level drive command, it was incompatible with the upcoming ROM03 Motherboard which Apple was about to release.
		Through their Switzerland office, Apple sent us a prototype of the ROM03 motherboard to make it work in time for the upcoming AppleFest in San Francisco, 
		where then VP Jean-Louis Gass&eacute;e used it during his talk.

		One of the successes of the first version of Nucleus was its very fast loading routines (even though most of the users
		only know the ROM03 version which does not include them!)
		Those fast routines came originally from SpeedySmith, a very fast disk copier but with limited features and raw (not to say crude) interface.
		</p>
		<p>
		After having written Nucleus during the summer, the FTA team gathered again the next month (just before going back to college) to create a new program that would be a mix between
		Speedysmith (for the copying features) and Nucleus (for the fancy graphics) : this is how Photonix started! 
		</p>
		<p>
		Thanks to the speed of the copy, its large set of features (it was often used by Mac users to quickly format disks for example), and its appealing interface, it became
		a very successful shareware program, and we were very pleased to receive (snail) mails from people around the world from persons liking our work and asking us to "keep up the good work" : 
		: it was then that we learnt how popular that expression was!<br /> 
		A commercial version of Photonix was later developed (Photonix II) and sold by Toolbox, before finishing its life as an abandonware.

		15 years later, Photonix was recently brought to life as a prior-artifact in an anti-virus

		At a time where there was no video console at home, arcade gaming was the only way to get a fully immersive experience, and Space Harrier was one of our favourite games. <br />
		This project emerged after having seen the Atari ST version that was really appealing, and we wanted to build something similar to bring that hi-speed spirit onto the IIGS.
		Actually, the project started with Atari ST development in order to extract (not to say rip) all the sprites from the computer memory while the game was running,
		 and then to transfer the files back to the IIGS. Exchanging information between computers seems so easy today, but at that time, it has required to build a custom
		NULL Modem cable, and find communication software on both machines that would implement the ZModem protocol in a similar way: needless to say that the whole process took several weeks!<br />
		With those nice looking assets available, it encouraged us to develop some great graphic routines that would nicely use them.<br />
		The result is one of our favorite productions, and even now, the version easily matches the official Sega version on iPhone (ok, their version is based on the Megadrive port)

    <p>The final demo from the FTA</p>
    <p>Even if it looks like a simple demo (as there's just one part), the Delta Demo contained some highly tuned code.<br />
    * First, for the first time on the IIGS, a MOD based music (thanks Moby!) that would go beyond the 64KB limit of the Ensoniq. 
    Those routines were later exposed in the NoiseTracker suite<br />
    *Second, a multi-threading simulator (!) : all the display was performed during the VBL interrupt, while the main processor 
    was creating the code to display the next object. Once the code was ready, then it was being used by the VBL interrupt, while the main processor works off the next object.
	 Quite fancy at that time, and this is what has allowed us to create 3D wireframe based real-time (or so) animation at 50hz per second on a 2.8Mhz processor!
	</p>
     <p>After having delivered so many products in 2 years, it was time for the team to move onto something else, but this version was a nice goodbye gift.
    <p>For the record, it was called the Delta demo to honour an Amiga Demo Maker who used to create everything himself : code, art & music!
